					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>Hello and welcome to my student homepage, I am Nathan Arcuri. Others would describe me as taciturn, easy-going, and inventive. I enjoy playing role playing video games that take me far away from reality. I am a self-taught musician and play guitar, piano, drums, and I also sing. I like to take apart and tinker with electronics. If I could be anywhere right now it would be Universal Studios, I could live there and it would never get old.</p>
					<h1>Education/Career Goals</h1>
					<p>In May of 2020, I was let go from my customer service job due to Covid-19-related budget cuts. I had spent a while building skills in an attempt to further my career with that corporation, and hopefully move on from the call center. Once my career ended there, I decided that I could not simply start over at another call center. When I came to terms with the fact that I would most likely never have a career that I enjoy without a degree, I decided to return to school to get a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. My goal is to work in the tech industry doing things that I love to do.</p>
