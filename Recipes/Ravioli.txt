Ravioli with Creamy Garlic Sauce

Ingredients:

280g (10 oz) ravioli (choose your favorite filling)
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp unsalted butter
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp lemon juice
250ml (1 cup) cream (20% fat) or half-and-half, at room temperature
55g (2 oz) grated Parmesan
50ml (¼ cup) white wine or chicken broth
1 tsp each: salt and black pepper
¼ tsp red pepper flakes
10 fresh sage leaves
55g (2 oz) roughly chopped pine nuts
Instructions:

Preparation: Mince the garlic and chop the pine nuts. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Toast Pine Nuts and Sage:

Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Add pine nuts and toast until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Add sage leaves and cook until crispy, about 1 minute.
Transfer pine nuts and sage to a plate lined with paper towel.
Make the Sauce:

Reduce heat to low and add butter to the skillet.
Once melted, add garlic and cook until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir in lemon juice, then add white wine. Simmer for 2 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper.
Pour in cream and bring to a boil, then simmer on low heat for 3 minutes.
Cook Ravioli:

Add ravioli to the boiling water and cook for about 3 minutes. Drain, reserving ¼ cup of the cooking water.
Finish the Sauce:

Add Parmesan to the cream sauce, stirring until combined. Simmer for 1 minute.
Add ravioli to the sauce, gently stirring to coat. If necessary, add a splash of reserved cooking water to thin out the sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning.
Serve: Top the ravioli with toasted pine nuts, crispy sage, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and additional black pepper.
