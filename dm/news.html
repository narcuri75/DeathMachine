                        It is with a heavy heart that we must announce the cancellation of the 2021 tour. We are deeply
                        saddened by this, but the state of the world has forced us to accept the unfortunate reality
                        that it would be irresponsible to subject our fans to the very real threat of
                        being infected with COVID-19. Please accept our deepest apologies 💔

                        Happy Holidays, everyone! We are excited to announce that we are planning a tour beginning
                        Summer 2021 to celebrate the release of MEGALITH. We are hopeful that the widespread release of
                        COVID-19 vaccines will make this a real possibility and a return to normalcy. Of course,
                        since things are so uncertain, please understand that tour dates, and the tour as a whole, are
                        subject to change. Thank you, and we hope to see you all in 2021! 🤞

                        This album came from a strange moment in history. Isolation shaped the tone, and we leaned into
                        expansive, reflective soundscapes alongside industrial grit. Recording this album was strange,
                        since each of us recorded our parts from home during lockdown and collaborated over Zoom.
                        Despite the circumstances, Megalith connected deeply with listeners, crossing 250 million
                        streams and reminding us how powerful
                        music can be when people need it most.

                        Written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, this album reflects isolation, uncertainty,

                        and a more introspective direction than previous releases. Let it be the soundtrack to your day,
                        wherever you find yourself.

                        over aggression. While physical sales slowed, the album found a new audience through
                        streaming platforms, surpassing 25 million total streams in its first year. It showed us that
                        experimentation can reach people in ways we did not expect. Stay curious 🪐
