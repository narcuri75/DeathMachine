          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my student homepage. My name is Nathan Arcuri, and I am someone who is often described
            as
            thoughtful, easy-going, and inventive. I have always been curious about how things work, which naturally led
            me
            toward creative and technical interests. I enjoy role playing video games because they offer immersive
            worlds and
            systems that reward problem solving, experimentation, and persistence. Those experiences have shaped how I
            think
            about challenges and how I approach learning new skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a self-taught musician with experience playing guitar, piano, and drums, and I also enjoy singing.
            Learning
            music on my own has taught me discipline, patience, and the value of consistent practice over time. I
            approach
            technology in much the same way. I enjoy taking apart electronics, troubleshooting issues, and understanding
            how
            individual components work together to create a complete system. That hands-on curiosity is what initially
            sparked
            my interest in computing and continues to motivate me as I pursue a deeper technical education.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of academics and technology, I appreciate environments that are creative, immersive, and
            thoughtfully designed.
            If I could be anywhere right now, it would be Universal Studios. I admire how it combines storytelling,
            engineering,
            and user experience into a single space that never feels repetitive. That blend of creativity and technical
            execution
            reflects the kind of work I hope to pursue in the future, building experiences and systems that are both
            functional and engaging.
          </p>

      <!-- GOALS -->
      <section class="card" id="goals" aria-labelledby="goals-title">
        <h2 id="goals-title">Education / Career Goals</h2>

        <div class="prose">
          <p>
            In May of 2020, I experienced an unexpected career shift when my customer service position ended due to
            company-wide
            budget changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. During my time there, I had been actively developing new
            skills and
            working toward opportunities beyond the call center, which gave me valuable insight into both professional
            growth and
            long-term career planning. That experience helped clarify what I wanted out of my work and the kind of
            challenges I
            found meaningful.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than viewing the situation as a setback, I treated it as an opportunity to reassess my goals and
            direction.
            I realized that simply moving into another similar role would not align with my interests or ambitions.
            After careful
            consideration, I made the decision to return to school and pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
            This path
            allows me to combine my curiosity, problem-solving mindset, and creativity into a field that is constantly
            evolving and
            deeply engaging.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal is to build a career in the technology industry where I can continue learning, create practical
            solutions, and
            contribute to work that I genuinely enjoy. By developing a strong technical foundation and expanding my
            skill set, I am
            working toward roles that allow me to grow professionally while doing work that challenges and motivates me.
